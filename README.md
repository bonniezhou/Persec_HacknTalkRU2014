A stylish bracelet that discreetly lights up when the wearer enters a crime-filled area.
The bracelet has 4 LED lights which will light up according to the level of danger at the wearer's current GPS location. We used crime data from San Francisco, which consisted of 32 thousand data points. The level of danger is determined by the number of crime instances, its recentness, and its severity ranked by category.
The bracelet is sleek, customizable, and unisex. The LEDs light up in a single colour and is very intuitive, where more lights indicate greater danger.

This project was created using Python, Arduino and 3D technology for Hack 'n' Talk 2014 at Ryerson University's Digital Media Zone.
